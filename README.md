This is a repo that shows the fundaentals of Logistic Regression, and implements a model to predict Cats in images, without the use of sklearn or other common ready-to-use libraries.

It will use numpy as the only main vectorization library, and matrix manuipulation. This is done with Neural Network in mind, and is based on [Deeplearning.ai](deeplearning.ai) course on [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/).
